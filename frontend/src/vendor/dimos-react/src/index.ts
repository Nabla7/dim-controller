// dimos-react: React UI toolkit for dimOS Desktop apps. Plain JS (no build step); React's createElement is `h`.
//
//     import { h, AppProvider, Button, useUrlState } from "https://esm.sh/gh/jeff-hykin/dimos-react@v0.1.0/mod.js?external=react,react-dom,three"
//
// The 3D view (three.js) is its own entry, ./three.js, so apps without a 3D view never load three.
